Key Observations
Both objects are stored in the same bucket because their hashCode() values are the same.
The equals() method finds that the objects are different because their names are different.
As a result, both objects are added to the HashSet.

What If equals() Considers Only the ID?
If the equals() method is implemented to compare only the ID:


@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) return true;
    if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
    CustomObject that = (CustomObject) obj;
    return id == that.id; // Compare only ID
}
In this case:

Only the first object (obj1) will be added to the HashSet.
The second object (obj2) will be considered equal to the first because they have the same ID.
